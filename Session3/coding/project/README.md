### Learning TypeScript Samples

The `samples` folder contains a simple project to illustrate various TypeScript features. The examples are best viewed from an IDE like [Visual Studio Code](https://jlik.me/cmn) for development-time feedback. From the folder, you can:

`npm install` to install pre-requisite dependencies.

`npm run tsc` builds JavaScript files from the examples.

`node 001-types` runs the first example.

`npm run start` builds and watches, useful for commenting/uncommenting code to walk through the example.
